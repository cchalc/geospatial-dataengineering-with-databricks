# Geospatial Data Engineering with Databricks

This repository contains resources and notebooks for geospatial workshops on Databricks. To get started, import this repository into your workspace (e.g. using Databricks Repos) and pick the topics you want to know more about. Backlinks help to revise relevant concepts.

## Prerequisites

This repository focuses on running geospatial workloads with python. Note that the Databricks runtime (DBR) and Databrickslabs project Mosaic have support for scala, python, SQL and R. Concepts and examples (that don't rely on external libs) can be converted to anyone of those languages.
In order to run the notebooks successfully, the following cluster configurations are needed:

DBR:
- 11.3 or higher (for geospatial H3 functions)
- Photon enabled (for geospatial H3 functions)

Libraries:
- Must be able to install mosaic library
